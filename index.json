My general areas of interest are computer vision, machine learning and augmented reality. My research focuses on improving visual localization using abstract object models.\nBefore starting my PhD, I have worked for 2 years at Kitware, as a computer vision engineer. I wrote my Master Thesis at SICK IVP, supervised by Ola Friman, on Super-resolution for Time-of-flight Cameras. I received a French Engineering degree from the UTC and a MSc from Linköping University, Sweden, both in Computer Science. I have also spent 6 months as an exchange student at Technische Universität Chemnitz in Germany.\nNews  [Aug 16, 2022] Accepted paper: OA-SLAM: Leveraging Objects for Camera Relocalization in Visual SLAM has been accepted to ISMAR 2022.
